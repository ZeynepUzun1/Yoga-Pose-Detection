# Image Classification with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Tensorflow and Keras to perform image classification. The model is trained on image data from Kaggle and evaluated on a separate test set.

## Model Architecture

This model consists of:

- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and Batch Normalization
- MaxPooling after each convolutional block
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
- A fully connected Dense layer followed by a softmax output layer

## Results

* Training accuracy: ~90%
* Validation accuracy: ~89%
